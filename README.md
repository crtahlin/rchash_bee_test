# rchash Bee test
Test Bee with rchash. 

## How to Use the Script:

Edit config.ini: Open config.ini and adjust the values for num_runs, pause_duration, storage_radius, neighbourhood, and log_file according to your testing needs.

Ensure Bee Node is Running: Make sure your Ethereum Bee node is running and accessible at http://localhost:1633.

Install curl (if not already installed): The script uses curl to interact with the Bee node API.

Run the script: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the files, and run the script using:

    python bee_test.py
